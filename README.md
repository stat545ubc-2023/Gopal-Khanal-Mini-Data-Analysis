# Project Information
This repository contains the files for the Individual Mini Data Analysis Project as a part of course STAT545 A taught in the fall 2023. The project includes two milestones. The purpose of *first* independent Mini Data Analysis Project is to gain familiarity with data manipulation, visulation and basic analysis of research questions using packages such as *ggplot2*, *dplyr* and other within *tidyverse* language. The *second* Mini Data Analysis Project aims to improve understanding of data manipulation and visualization, and analysis and interpretation of data, and generate a reproducible using R Markdown. The `flow_sample` data available in package *datateachr* was used for this project.

**There are three folders in this repository, and their description is provided below** 

Folders | Info
--------|-------
Milestone 1 | This folder contains all the files (R markdown file, knitted github .md file, and folder than contains figures) 
Milestone 2 |  This folder contains all the files(R markdown file, knitted github .md file, and folder than contains figures) 
output | This folder contains the output (csv file, R objects) from Milestone 2 (task 4)

## **Mini Data Analysis 1**

The mini data analysis 1 included three main tasks:
1.  Selecting a favourite dataset from the library *datateachr*
2.  Exploring the selected dataset (e.g., subseting the data, identifying miss values, creating new variables and       
    exploring relationship between variables.
3.  Selecting a research question for further data exploration, visualization and analysis

### **Mini Data Analysis 1 Files**

-   **mini-project1_README.md:** This is a description of repository of milestone 1
-   **mini-project1.Rmd:** This is the R markdown file for milestone 1 with all codes and tasks
-   **mini-project1.md:** This is a knitted github document that includes all task completed for milestone 1 
-   **mini-project-1_files:** This folder contains all the figures generated from milestone 1

  
  ## **Mini Data Analysis 2**
The mini data analysis 2 included four main tasks:
1. Manipulating and summarizing the data selected in milestone 1 (e.g., creating summary statistics, graphing the 
   variables)
2. Making the data Tidy (e.g., converting the data in longer and wider format) 
3. Modelling (e.g., basic statistical analysis or hypothesis testing, reading outputs)
4. Reading and writing the data

### **Mini Data Analysis 2 Files**

-   **mini-project2_README.md:** This is a description of repository of milestone 2
-   **mini-project2.Rmd:** This is the R markdown file for milestone 2 with all codes and tasks
-   **mini-project2.md:** This is a knitted github document that includes all task completed for milestone 2 
-   **mini-project-2_files:** This folder contains all the figures generated from milestone 2
  

# Accesss of the project contents and run the codes in your repository
-   You can view the outputs of both milestones by clicking on respective knitted github documents. 
-   You can download the zip file by clicking the "\< \> Code" button in the upper right-hand corner and then "Download ZIP" option, and work in your local PC as you want.
-   You can also create a new project in RStudio by selecting "Version Control" option then pasting the github repository URL in -\> "Git" (clone a project from a Git repository) -\>. You can then save the cloned project in your local folder.  You can pull the main branch of the repository to your pc. You can make necessary changes, suggestions, and commit and push the committs to the online github repo.
